Hello! I'm currently immersed in the world of Data Science at Seattle University, advancing my skills after a rewarding four-year stint as a Data Consultant. My journey began India, where I served as a Senior Data Consultant at Syniti and a Data Engineer at Wipro Technologies. During this time, I honed my abilities in building and deploying ML models, crafting robust data engineering/ETL pipelines, and utilizing tools like Python, SQL, and various cloud platforms.

In the professional arena, I am driven by the belief in delivering tangible, impactful products. My forte lies in translating data-driven insights into practical solutions, a skill cultivated through hands-on experience and a passion for making a real-world difference. Whether it's constructing ML models or engineering data pipelines, I thrive on bringing projects to life, ensuring they go beyond theoretical concepts to serve practical, utilitarian purposes.

Task prioritization is another strong suit of mine, a skill that extends from the technical intricacies of data science to the broader landscape of project management. I have a keen eye for discerning what truly matters, ensuring that efforts are concentrated on the most critical elements for success. This ability has proven invaluable in navigating the fast-paced world of data science, where efficiency and impact are paramount.

Beyond the world of data, my interests span into the realm of psychology. I find joy in exploring the intricacies of the human mind through psychology books, enriching my understanding of behavior and contributing to a holistic perspective in my professional endeavors. As I navigate through my Master's program, I look forward to further refining my skills and making meaningful contributions that bridge the gap between data science and the practical needs of businesses.
